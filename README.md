My current research interest is in LLM-powered autonomous agents. I am especially excited by the prospect of improving model performance and decision-making through (a.) providing relevant information as context through intelligent search techniques (vectorized/embedding-based information retrieval), and (b.) self-improvement and automatic feedback mechanisms such as self-refine.
