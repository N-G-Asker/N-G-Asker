## Research Interest
My current research interest is in LLM-powered autonomous agents.

I am especially excited by the prospect of improving model performance and decision-making through 

- retrieval-augmented generation (RAG): providing relevant information as context using intelligent search techniques (using vector- or embedding-indexed databases), and
  
- self-improvement and automatic feedback mechanisms such as self-refine.


## Background
I like coding because it lets me find flow, be curious, and create. I'm interested in machine learning in particular because of its potential to solve otherwise intractable problems.

I recently graduated with a masters in computer science from Columbia University (May 2024). I chose the Machine Learning track  as my specialization and am especially passionate about Large Language Models (LLMs) and deep learning.

My first exposure to coding came while I was a cybersecurity consultant (2017 - 2021), where I had the opportunity to pick up Python. I felt great joy learning to program for the first time and suddenly realized how much constructive power a programmer has – literally at their fingertips – with the capacity to create highly useful and beautiful things through code. So, I committed to going back to school to study computer science – to build a firm engineering foundation and pivot my career into something I loved.

The first half of my graduate program consisted of fundamental coursework in data structures, algorithms, systems programming, and mathematics. Through this portion of the program, I became a proficient programmer in C, Python, and Java and developed strong problem-solving skills. In the latter half, I shifted focus to topics in Artificial Intelligence $-$ including Natural Language Processing (NLP), Language Generation, Computer Vision, and Robot Learning $-$ and conducted research in these areas:

- __TasteRank__: Personalized Image Search and Recommendation [[Paper]](https://github.com/N-G-Asker/TasteRank/blob/main/TasteRank-paper.pdf)
  
- __Whiteboard then Code__: Refining Code Generation via Iterative Automatic Feedback from Peer LLMs [[Paper]](https://github.com/N-G-Asker/whiteboard-then-code/blob/main/whiteboard-then-code_research-paper.pdf)
